The Liskov Substitution Principle

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- If a class inherits from another class, it should be able to replace the base class without breaking functionality.
- The derived (sub) class must not remove or change the behavior expected from the base class.
- This ensures that polymorphism works correctly and the software remains maintainable.
