The Open-Closed Principle

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Open for extension - be able to add new functionality to a class withoud modifying it's existing code.
- Closed for modification - once a class is developed and tested, it should not be changed. New functionality should be added via inheritance, interfaces or composition.

✅ No need to modify existing code
✅ Easier to test
