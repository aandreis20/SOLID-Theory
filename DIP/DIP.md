The Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- Instead of directly depending on concrete implementations, classes should depend on abstractions (e.g., protocols or interfaces).
- This makes code loosely coupled, easier to extend, and more maintainable.
- It promotes Dependency Injection, which allows for better testability.

✅ Loose coupling
✅ Easier to extend
✅ Better testability
