The Interface Segregation Principle

- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- A class should only implement methods that are relevant to it.
- Instead of having large, monolithic interfaces, we should split them into smaller, more specific interfaces.
- This avoids forcing classes to implement unnecessary methods.

✅ Avoids unnecessary method implementations
✅ Improves code clarity
✅ Encourages maintainability
