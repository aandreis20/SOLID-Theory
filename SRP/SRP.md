The Single Responsibility Principle

- A class should do one thing and therefore it should have only one single reason to change
- This means that a class should have only one responsibility or function in the system.
- If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one part of the system might require modifications in unrelated parts, making the system harder to maintain and more prone to bugs.
- Each responsibility should be handled by a separate class, ensuring that changes in one responsibility do not affect others.

✅ Easier Maintenance
✅ Better Testability
✅ Scalability
